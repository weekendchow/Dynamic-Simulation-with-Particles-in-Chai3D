# Dynamic-Simulation-with-Particles-in-Chai3D
This course project is mainly aims at developing a particle system includes 3 particles connected with springs, falling from certain height and collide with a plane then bounce back. The plane was draw by cMesh(AABB collision detector). Set fixed or random initial position, then update the position and velocity using Forward Euler Integration. Also complete functions in keyselect(adjust parameters/switch mode/restart falling). This project was simulated in Visual Studio environment by using C++, OpenGL and C++ simulation framework Chai 3D.
